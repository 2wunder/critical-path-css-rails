# Backlog

## Tests
- Add a testing suite (preferably rspec)

## Features
- Allow the user to pass arguments to Penthouse.js, i.e. Viewport size, etc. For a list of the configurable options, please see [Penthouse](https://github.com/pocketjoso/penthouse)
- Improve installation process, if necessary
- Improve manual processes, if possible (i.e having to run the rake task to generate the the critical CSS)
- Improve implementation. Is their a better solution then using Rails.cache?
